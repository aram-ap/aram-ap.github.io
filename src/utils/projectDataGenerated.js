We developed a payload for a suborbital research mission launching from Wallops Flight Facility, aimed at studying atmospheric and space environments with a deployable capsule reaching over 100km in altitude.\n\nIn my role as Software Lead, I designed and implemented the flight software systems, collaborated closely with hardware teams, and focused on ensuring reliability in the demanding space environment. There were tough moments balancing this with my coursework, but pushing through taught me invaluable lessons in resilience.\n\n<!-- slideshow:mission-overview:buttons -->\n\n## Leadership Role\n\n**Software Team Lead** - I guided a team of 8 fellow students, establishing coding standards, review processes, and development workflows while navigating the pressures of college life.\n\n- Introduced agile practices to meet the rigorous space mission timeline—it took some trial and error, but it kept us on track\n- Implemented code review protocols and testing frameworks that prevented major issues\n- Collaborated with NASA engineers, an experience that was equal parts intimidating and inspiring\n- Delivered flight-ready software on schedule, despite the occasional all-nighter\n\n## Technical Achievements\n\nCreating software resilient enough for suborbital flight conditions was a steep learning curve—I dove deep into embedded systems and fault tolerance. Here's what we accomplished:\n\n- Real-time data acquisition and telemetry systems built to withstand extreme vibrations\n- A fault-tolerant architecture that maintained operations even under stress\n- Autonomous experiment control and data logging for the flight duration\n- Ground communication protocols that required meticulous refinement\n- Pre-flight simulation environments for thorough testing and validation\n\n## Mission Completion\n\nThe 2024 RockSat-X mission achieved its core objectives, but we faced a setback with the radio antennas breaking during launch—it was disappointing.\n\n- Successfully deployed one of three capsules\n- Failure to collect data due to antenna breakage\n- Unforseen failure in radio systems\n- Lots of learning\n\n<!-- slideshow:launch-day:buttons -->\n\n## Technical Learnings\n\nThis mission taught me invaluable lessons about the intersection of software engineering and aerospace systems. The experience shaped my understanding of reliable system design and the importance of thorough testing.\n"
