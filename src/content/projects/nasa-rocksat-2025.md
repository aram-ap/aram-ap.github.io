# NASA RockSat-X 2025

## Mission Overview

Serving as Electrical Lead for NASA's RockSat-X 2025 mission, building upon the 2024 flight with enhanced payload capabilities, improved electrical systems. This mission features advanced sensing capabilities and more sophisticated data acquisition systems.

As Electrical Lead, I'm responsible for all electrical subsystems, power distribution, signal conditioning, embedded programming, and ensuring electromagnetic compatibility for the harsh space environment.

Lead development of the A.T.L.A.S - Advanced Three-Dimensional LiDAR Apparatus for Space. The ATLAS is a topographic 3D scanning system developed to identify and model the outer shell of space vehicles, used for identifying structural anomolies and damage during space flight. Utilizes an infrared time-of-flight sensor, MEMS mirror, and rotating mirror assembly which extends outwards at apogee.

## Leadership & Team

**Electrical Team Lead** - Leading development of all electrical systems, managing PCB design, system integration, and testing protocols for space-qualified hardware.

- Coordinating electrical design with mechanical and software teams
- Implementing rigorous testing and qualification procedures
- Writing code for all embedded microcontroller systems
- Managing component selection for space environment reliability
- Establishing design standards and review processes

## Technical Systems

Designing and implementing next-generation electrical systems for enhanced scientific capabilities, including:

- Multi-layer PCB design for high-speed digital systems
- Low-noise analog front-end for sensitive measurements
- Redundant power distribution and protection systems
- High-reliability connectors and cable assemblies
- EMI shielding and grounding for space environment

## Innovation & Improvements

Building on lessons learned from 2024, implementing significant improvements and new technologies for enhanced mission capabilities:

- Advanced power management with smart switching systems
- Improved signal conditioning for higher accuracy measurements
